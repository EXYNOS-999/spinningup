AWS DeepRacer Workflow

In just a minute, you’ll have a chance to get into the AWS DeepRacer Console and build your first model. But before doing that, let’s walk through the workflow behind AWS DeepRacer. Throughout this course, you’ll get to dig in deeper to all of these separate steps, but for now, just take a minute to understand what’s happening at a more superficial level.

Whether you end up racing on a virtual or physical track, you’ll want to start in the simulated environment – building, training, evaluating, and repeating that process until you’ve optimized your model enough so that you think it’s ready to compete. Then, if you’d like, you can deploy to the actual physical car.

This all starts with creating a model in the AWS DeepRacer console. You use the console for model configuration. Once built, the simulator is used to train and then evaluate your model. The simulator is a great tool: you can see in real time how your model is responding to the settings you’ve chosen.

After your model is trained, you can evaluate its performance in the simulator, which yields the percentage of the lap complete for each of your runs, plus the overall time it took to complete each run.

If you like what you’ve done with your trained and evaluated model, you can clone it and start to tweak your configurations for increased performance.

Once you have a model that’s performing to meet your expectations, deploy it to the car and get started racing on the physical track, or compete with your model via virtual track events.
