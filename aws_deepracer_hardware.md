AWS DeepRacer Scholarship Challenge


 In pole position to learn reinforcement learning

AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale race car which gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique which takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

With AWS DeepRacer, you now have a way to get hands-on with RL, experiment, and learn through autonomous driving. You can get started with the virtual car and tracks in the cloud-based 3D racing simulator, and for a real-world experience, you can deploy your trained models onto AWS DeepRacer and race your friends, or take part in the global AWS DeepRacer League. Developers, the race is on.


Built for reinforcement learning

AWS DeepRacer was designed with reinforcement learning in mind. It gives you an out-of-the-box RL solution including a simple, yet powerful, interface to train and fine-tune models, integrated 3D racing simulation environment, and simple simulation-to-real-world domain transfer capabilities.

AWS and Udacity are teaming up to teach machine learning and prepare students to test their skills by participating in the world’s first autonomous racing league—the AWS DeepRacer League. Students with the top lap times will earn full scholarships to the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.
 

Welcome to the race!

We’re excited to have you join us for this exciting new Scholarship Challenge! Here are some helpful details as you start the program:

How the Scholarship Challenge works

The race is on. Ready, set...learn!

The lessons in this short course have been specially designed to prepare you to create, train, and fine-tune reinforcement learning models for submissions in the AWS DeepRacer League.

While we recommend you take the time to go through these insightful lessons, course completion is not required to qualify for a Nanodegree scholarship. Instead, Nanodegree scholarships will be provided to students with the best racing scores in the August, September, and October AWS DeepRacer races, as well as to students who record the highest total point scores across all 3 months. 

FIRST AUTONOMUS GLOBAL LEAGUE---///

LESSON 2:


Throughout the course, you'll learn about:

    the car's tech specs, assembly and calibration
    the basics of reinforcement learning and its use in AWS DeepRacer
    building, training and deploying your racing model using AWS in both simulated and real-world tracks
    how to compete in the DeepRacer League

Steering Calibration Recap

To calibrate your steering:

    Place your car on a block (secure it with duct tape or similar) to keep it in place while the wheels move.
    Get your vehicle’s IP address from when it was set up to use wi-fi.
    Sign in to the AWS DeepRacer console with that IP address as instructed here.
    Select Calibration, then Calibrate Steering Angle from the console (see here).
    Calibrate your center steering first. Remember: Due to the concepts of Ackermann steering, only one wheel will actually be straight when you calibrate center steering.
    Calibrate your left steering by choosing the value where your vehicle wheels will turn no further left.
    Calibrate your right steering by choosing the value where your vehicle wheels will turn no further right.

Next up, you will calibrate your throttle to control speed!
