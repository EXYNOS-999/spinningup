AWS DeepRacer
The fastest way to get rolling with machine learning, literally


Get hands-on with a fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning, 3D racing simulator , and global racing league.

Developers, start your engines! Welcome to the world’s first global autonomous racing league, open to anyone. It’s time to race for prizes, glory, and a chance to advance to the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup at re:Invent 2019 to win the coveted AWS DeepRacer Cup.

Top the leaderboard in one of the Virtual Circuit or Summit Circuit races, and you will be eligible to win your expenses paid trip to re:Invent 2019. The top 10 racers will also win AWS DeepRacer cars. You’ll receive points for each race you participate in and your points will accumulate throughout 2019 with the top point scorers in each circuit eligible to win a trip to compete in the AWS DeepRacer knockout rounds at re:Invent.

Features and benefits
Build machine learning models

AWS DeepRacer allows developers of any skill level to get started with machine learning with hands-on tutorials and guidance on building reinforcement learning models. Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning, ideal for training autonomous vehicles.
Evaluate models in the 3D simulator

AWS DeepRacer has an integrated simulation environment hosted on the AWS Cloud for experimentation and optimization of your autonomous racing models, built with reinforcement learning. Train your models and get ready to race in the League.
Compete in the Virtual Circuit

Once you have evaluated and tuned your reward function and hyperparameters to complete a lap of the track, submit your model to the virtual leaderboard to enter the AWS DeepRacer League. Race for prizes and glory from anywhere in the world and a chance to advance and win the AWS DeepRacer Championship Cup.
Race in the Summit Circuit

Join us at any of the 20 AWS Summits, globally, where you can bring your trained model to a race track and test it out in a real-world racing environment.


Pricing (US)

The AWS DeepRacer service is built on existing AWS services. You will be charged based on your usage of each of these services and they will show up on your end of month billing statement.

The average charge for a one-hour training job is comprised of Amazon SageMaker and AWS RoboMaker charges. These charges depend on compute requirement and the track used and typically cost between $3 and $5 depending on the Simulation Units needed for that track. Estimated Simulation Units per hour range from 6 Simulation Units for the re:Invent track to 9 for the July 2019 track in the monthly AWS DeepRacer League Virtual Circuit.

SageMaker: C4.2XL for 1 hour = $0.557
RoboMaker: 6-9 Simulation Units for 1 hour = $2.40 to $3.60

The AWS DeepRacer Free Tier provides enough credits in the first 30 days to create, train, evaluate and submit your first model to the virtual circuit by offsetting up to 10 hours of SageMaker training and 60 RoboMaker Simulation Units charges.
