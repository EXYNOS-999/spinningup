AWS DeepRacer Scholarship Challenge


https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/


AWS and Udacity are teaming up to teach machine learning and prepare students to test their skills by participating in the world’s first autonomous racing league—the AWS DeepRacer League. Students with the top lap times will earn full scholarships to the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.
 

Welcome to the race!

We’re excited to have you join us for this exciting new Scholarship Challenge! Here are some helpful details as you start the program:

How the Scholarship Challenge works

The race is on. Ready, set...learn!

The lessons in this short course have been specially designed to prepare you to create, train, and fine-tune reinforcement learning models for submissions in the AWS DeepRacer League.

While we recommend you take the time to go through these insightful lessons, course completion is not required to qualify for a Nanodegree scholarship. Instead, Nanodegree scholarships will be provided to students with the best racing scores in the August, September, and October AWS DeepRacer races, as well as to students who record the highest total point scores across all 3 months.
